Features :-

Current Temperature: See the current temperature in your area.

Humidity: Check the humidity level, displayed as a percentage.

Wind Speed: Get the current wind speed in kilometers per hour (km/h).

Cloud Cover: View the current cloud cover conditions.

Visual Weather Indicator: An image changes dynamically to represent the current weather, such as sunny, cloudy, or rainy.

How It Works

The application fetches real-time weather data and uses it to update the displayed information. Based on the current weather condition (e.g., Clear, Clouds, Rain, Mist, Snow), it selects and shows an appropriate image from a local folder.

Example:

If the weather is Clear, the app will show an image of a clear sky.

If the weather is Rain, it will display an image of rain.
